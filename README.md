# Sales_Prediction
The project aims to predict the sales of a product based on advertising spend across different channels: TV, Newspaper, and Radio.
Data Exploration:
Analyzed the relationship between Sales and advertising spend on TV, Newspaper, and Radio.
Visualized correlations to identify the strongest predictor.
Model Development:
Built a simple linear regression model using TV as the independent variable and Sales as the dependent variable.
Evaluated model performance using the RÂ² metric, achieving an accuracy of 0.8026.
Insights and Recommendations:
Provided actionable insights on the impact of TV advertising on sales and recommended further analysis for other advertising channels.
Results:
The model explains 80.26% of the variance in Sales based on TV advertising spend, suggesting that TV is a significant driver of sales.
